# This file contains definitions for automatically assigned properties.
# The format of this file is one definition per line.
# An AutoAward definition is of the following form:
# [CHARACTER-BASED ZAPPERMASK] :: [DATE-BASED ZAPPERMASK] :: [ABILITY_ID]([ARGS])...
# [CHARACTER-BASED ZAPPERMASK] is a zapper mask denoting players who will be given
# these properties.  Do not include any day/month/year/etc based checks here, but
# birthday/birthmonth/etc are OK. See archon help on Zapper Masks (AHELP
# ZAPPERMASKS) from the command line for syntax on zapper-masks.
# [DATE-BASED ZAPPERMASK] is a zapper mask that selects any date/time related
# criteria, based on the home-area of the character.  Include only masks like
# HOUR, MONTH, DAY, WEEK, YEAR, etc.  Put BIRTHDAY, etc type masks up in the
# character based section. See archon help on zappermasks.
# [ABILITY_ID]([ARGS]) one or more space-delimited property/ability ids,
# with any arguments in parenthesis.
#
# AutoAward definitions are assigned to players at boot/creation time according
# to the character zappermask, and then periodically have the appropriate date-based
# masks checked to confirm changes.
#
# Example:
# -RACE +ELF :: -MONTH +1 +3 +5 +7 :: Prop_Adjuster(str+2)
